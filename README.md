# iCKB

## Listenable Introduction

If you would like to listen to an introduction of the project before diving in, Jordan Mack explains iCKB in less than 7 minutes during an episode of [Hashing it Out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CcFFuenup38&t=781s).

## Problem

### NervosDAO Illiquidity

The NervosDAO is possibly the most important smart-contract of Nervos Layer 1 (L1). A CKB holder can lock his CKB in the NervosDAO in exchange for a receipt of that specific deposit. Every 180 epochs (~30 days) the depositor has the option of exchanging his receipt to unlock his initial deposit plus accrued interest. This creates an illiquidity for the depositor while the CKB is locked.

### Untapped Potential

There exists untapped potential in the Nervos ecosystem for a protocol that can liquify NervosDAO accrued interest and bridge it from L1 to L2. This protocol could enable CKB-based [Initial Stake Pool Offerings](https://www.meld.com/ispo) (ISPO), where users can lock CKB to support new early stage projects without losing their original CKB deposit.

The protocol could also be used to enable a community voting mechanism with funds locked in the NervosDAO, as well as a multitude more L1 & L2 applications!

Looking far away, this protocol could also enable Godwoken switch from pCKB to a new native token that protects every Godwoken user from CKB issuance.

### dCKB (Unmaintained)

In the past there has been an effort to tackle this challenge by [NexisDAO with dCKB](https://docs.nexisdao.com/nexisdao/mint-dckb). Their approach is to tokenize the holder receipt, which in turn becomes tradeable and so the holder keeps being liquid. The issue with their approach is that only the original owner can unlock the deposit. Judging by their [GitHub repository's issues](https://github.com/NexisDao/NexisDao-core/issues), dCKB does not appear to be actively maintained.

## Solution

### Enter iCKB

iCKB is the name for a [SUDT token](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0025-simple-udt/0025-simple-udt.md) that represents deposits in the protocol. As with dCKB, iCKB's approach is to tokenize NervosDAO receipts, but with a twist: the protocol owns all the CKB deposits and maintains a pool of them. This means that all the deposits and withdrawals are shared, so anyone can use anyone else's deposit to exit once it's mature.

This protocol aims to solve two problems with NervosDAO:

- CKB locked in the NervosDAO remains liquid as iCKB can truly be used as a normal currency.
- iCKB can be converted back to CKB quickly at any time without having to wait for maturity.

### Water Mill Analogy

As a [water mill](https://tenor.com/view/water-wheel-mill-gif-19806697) has many distinct buckets, each at different wheel positions, in which the water is:

- Collected
- Maintained
- Released

In the same way, the protocol can have many distinct deposits, each of them constantly moving at different stages of maturity:

- **Collected**: Users deposit CKB and receive iCKB.
- **Maintained**: Deposits accrue interest in the NervosDAO.
- **Released**: If a user wants to exchange iCKB for CKB, they can use any deposit that is at maturity.

### Feedback

Jordan Mack's comments on Nervos L1 & iCKB:
> In a more abstract sense, this doesn't violate any of intentions of the platform. The CKB that is staked is still out of circulation. iCKB does not grant the holder the ability to store data on the blockchain. In the most pure sense, iCKB is enabling the functionality that dCKB was trying to achieve. It better solves the problem because anyone can unlock the original CKB from the NervosDAO using iCKB instead of requiring the original owner to unlock it as with dCKB.

## Team

### Phroi

I'm the the ideas baker and solidity developer behind Opthy, 3Â° among peers at August 2021 Hackathon! [Phroi](http://phroi.com) as pseudonym exists since that Hackathon, here you can find the code I wrote in that occasion: [core](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-core), [tests](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-tests) and [ui](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-ui-web). Later on I continued working with Hexmate on [Opthy](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v1-core) until May 2022, when I left for becoming a solo Indie Hacker. Since then I'm working on a few projects under different pseudonyms.

### Discovering iCKB

During February 2022, while [testing the ground for a NervosDAO based ISPO](https://discord.com/channels/657799690070523914/657799690552606745/943306112889933864), I discovered the untapped need for a token that liquefies and bridges interests from L1 to L2 and so with Jordan Macks's help I started researching its feasibility.

## Diving Into The Protocol

### On-Chain, Trust-Less and Decentralized

This protocol defines a solid way to exchange between CKB and iCKB. The design aim is to make iCKB as simple, robust and neutral as possible, making it capable of meeting the current and future needs of Nervos users.

This protocol lives completely on Nervos Layer 1. Once deployed no entity have control over it, so it's not upgradable.

It works by wrapping NervosDAO transactions: a deposit is first tracked by its protocol receipt and later on it's converted in its equivalent amount of iCKB.

### iCKB/CKB Exchange Rate Idea

The iCKB mechanism for wrapping interest is similar to [Compound's cTokens](https://compound.finance/docs/ctokens). The CKB to iCKB exchange rate is determined by block number. At the genesis block `1 CKB` is equal to `1 iCKB`. As time passes `1 CKB` is slowly worth less than `1 iCKB` at a rate that matches the issuance from the NervosDAO. This is because iCKB is gaining value. An easier way to understand this is to think of:

- CKB as inflationary
- iCKB as non-inflationary

Jordan Mack's comment on this method:
> That's a clever approach. Thinking of it as iCKB being the base and CKB being what is moving makes it much easier to understand.

The inflation rate of CKB is well defined by the [NervosDAO compensation rate](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/nominal-apc) and only depends on:

- [The block concept in L1](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary/#block)
- [The epoch concept in L1](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary/#epoch)
- [The formula itself](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation)

Therefore, the iCKB/CKB exchange rate will always be precise as determined by the formula and the current block. The only risk to this deterministic peg would be a smart contract exploit to the deposit pool or minting contract. These kinds of attack vectors are greatly mitigated by external audits.

### iCKB-Equivalent Deposit Size

As in real life bricks can be used to build houses of any size, in the same way seems natural to establish a reasonably small standard deposit size that can be used to construct deposits of any size.

In this way a few goals are achieved:

- Big deposits increase the overall protocol liquidity.
- No size mismatch means anybody can use anybody else deposit to withdraw.

This deposit standard size could be defined in CKB terms or in iCKB terms:

- Defining it in CKB terms means that as deposits are made in time, every deposit would have a different size due to the NervosDAO interests, so it's not working as intended.
- Defining it in iCKB terms means that at every block the standard deposit would have the same size both in CKB and iCKB. Of course as time passes, the deposit size would be fixed in iCKB-equivalent terms but gradually increasing in CKB terms.

Let's define `10000 iCKB` as the standard deposit size.

### iCKB/CKB Exchange Rate Calculation

Excluding deposit cell occupied capacity, per definition `10000 iCKB` are equal to `10000 CKB` staked in NervosDAO at the genesis block, let's calculate what this means.

From the last formula from [NervosDAO RFC Calculation section](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation):
> Nervos DAO compensation can be calculated for any deposited cell. Assuming a Nervos DAO cell is deposited at block `m`, i.e. the `deposit cell` is included at block `m`. One initiates withdrawal and gets phase 1 `withdrawing cell` included at block `n`. The total capacity of the `deposit cell` is `c_t`, the occupied capacity for the `deposit cell` is `c_o`. [...] The maximum withdrawable capacity one can get from this Nervos DAO input cell is:
>
> `( c_t - c_o ) * AR_n / AR_m + c_o`

`AR_n` is defined in the [NervosDAO RFC Calculation section](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation):

> CKB's block header has a particular field named `dao` containing auxiliary information for Nervos DAO's use. Specifically [...] `AR_i`: the current `accumulated rate` at block `i`. `AR_j / AR_i` reflects the CKByte amount if one deposit 1 CKB to Nervos DAO at block `i`, and withdraw at block `j`.

Let's fix a few constants:

- `c_o = 82 CKB` (occupied cell capacity of a standard deposit cell)
- `c_t = 10082 CKB` (total cell capacity equals the iCKB-equivalent deposit size plus its occupied capacity)
- `m = 0` (deposit block is the genesis block)
- `AR_m = AR_0 = 10 ^ 16` (genesis accumulated rate)

So at block `n`:
`10000 iCKB  = 10000 CKB * AR_n / 10 ^ 16 + 82 CKB`

This shows that the iCKB/CKB exchange rate only depends on a few constants and `AR_n`, the block `n` accumulated rate.

### Deposit

In NervosDAO a CKB holder can lock his CKB in exchange for a NervosDAO receipt of that specific deposit in a single transaction.

In the proposed protocol, as in NervosDAO, deposits can be of any size, but deposits bigger than the standard deposit size are actively disincentivized: the user will receive only 90% of the iCKB amount exceeding a standard deposit. The remaining 10% is offered as a discount to whoever is willing to withdraw from the oversized deposits.

The optimal strategy for a CKB holder is to split his CKB into NervosDAO standard deposit cells. Each deposit cell is then locked by the protocol lock script and it is followed by either:
    - Another deposit cell with its exact same unoccupied CKB capacity.
    - A protocol receipt, which respectfully to the immediately preceding deposit cells, just contains their count and single deposit unoccupied CKB capacity.

```yaml
CellDeps:
    - iCKB script cell
    - Nervos DAO script cell
    - ...
Inputs:
    - ...
Outputs:
    - Nervos DAO deposit cell with iCKB protocol lock:
        Data: 8 bytes filled with zeros
        Type: Nervos DAO
        Lock:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
    - ... # From none to 254 exact clones of the preceding Deposit cell
    - Token and Receipt:
        Data:
            token_amount: 0 (8 bytes)
            receipt_amount: Single deposit unoccupied capacity (7 bytes)
            receipt_count: Quantity of immediately preceding deposits (1 byte)
        Type:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
        Lock: ...
```

### Transfer

While a receipt it's an valid deposit, so it's accruing interests and it can be used to withdraw, it's not transferrable as it is.

A receipt must be converted in its equivalent iCKB token amount in order to transfer it. This conversion is now possible because the header of the receipt block is available.

As seen in [iCKB/CKB Exchange Rate Calculation](#ickbckb-exchange-rate-calculation) for each receipt the equivalent amount of iCKB is well defined. The only difference being the incentivization: oversized receipts are subject to a 10% fee on the amount exceeding a standard deposit.

```yaml
CellDeps:
    - iCKB script cell
    - ...
HeaderDeps: 
    - Deposit block
    - ...
Inputs:
    - Token and Receipt:
        Data: [token_amount, receipt_amount, receipt_count]
        Type:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
        Lock: ...
    - ...
    - Nervos DAO deposit cell with iCKB protocol lock:
        Data: 8 bytes filled with zeros
        Type: Nervos DAO
        Lock:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
    - ...
Outputs:
    - Token and Receipt:
        Data:
            token_amount: Input token amount + receipts iCKB value
            receipt_amount: Empty
            receipt_count: Empty
        Type:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
        Lock: ...
```

### Withdrawal

In NervosDAO time is slotted in batches of 180 epochs depending on the initial deposit timing, a withdrawal is split in two steps:

1. In the first transaction the user requests the withdrawal.
2. In the second transaction the user withdraws the deposit plus interests. Must be after the end of the 180 epoch batch in which the first transaction happened.

As seen in [NervosDAO RFC Calculation section](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation) the actual withdrawn CKB amount depends on the deposit block and on the withdrawal request block.

The proposed protocol instead proceed by un-wrapping iCKB tokens into regular NervosDAO withdrawal cells:

1. In the first transaction the user:
    - Requests the withdrawal from some protocol controlled deposits.
    - Burns an exactly equivalent total amount of iCKB tokens and receipts.
2. The second transaction is just a regular Nervos DAO second withdrawal step transaction.

As seen in [iCKB/CKB Exchange Rate Calculation](#ickbckb-exchange-rate-calculation) for each deposit and receipt the equivalent amount of iCKB is well defined. The only difference being the incentivization: requesting the withdrawal from an oversized deposit is incentivized by a 10% discount on the amount exceeding a standard deposit.

```yaml
CellDeps:
    - iCKB script cell
    - Nervos DAO script cell
    - ...
HeaderDeps: 
    - Deposit block
    - ...
Inputs:
    - Nervos DAO deposit cell with iCKB protocol lock:
        Data: 8 bytes filled with zeros
        Type: Nervos DAO
        Lock:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
    - Token and Receipt:
        Data: [token_amount, receipt_amount, receipt_count]
        Type:
            CodeHash: iCKB script
            HashType: Data1
            Args: Empty
        Lock: ...
    - ...
Outputs:
    - Nervos DAO phase 1 withdrawal cell:
        Data: Deposit cell's including block number
        Type: Nervos DAO
        Lock: ...
    - ...
```

## Future

Once iCKB is deployed, it will enable:

- CKB-based Initial Stake Pool Offerings.
- The official Nervos DAO community voting mechanism.
- Godwoken switch from pCKB to iCKB, protecting users from CKB issuance.
- A multitude more L1 & L2 applications!
