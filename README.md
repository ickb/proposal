# Proposal: Project CKB++

## Background

### NervosDAO Illiquidity

The NervosDAO is possibly the most important smart-contract of Nervos Layer 1 (L1). A CKB holder can lock his CKB in the NervosDAO in exchange for a receipt of that specific deposit. Every 180 epochs (~30 days) the holder has the option of exchanging his receipt to unlock his initial deposit plus accrued interest. This creates an illiquidity for depositor while the CKB is locked.

### Untapped Potential

There exists untapped potential in the Nervos ecosystem for a protocol that can liquify NervosDAO accrued interest and bridge it from L1 to L2. This protocol could enable CKB-based [Initial Stake Pool Offerings](https://www.meld.com/ispo) (ISPO), where users can lock CKB to support new early stage projects without losing their original CKB deposit. The protocol could also be used to enable a community voting mechanism with funds locked in the NervosDAO, as well as a multitude more L1 & L2 applications!

### DCKB (Unmaintained)

In the past there has been an effort to tackle this challenge by [NexisDAO with dCKB](https://docs.nexisdao.com/nexisdao/mint-dckb). Their approach is to tokenize the holder receipt, which in turn becomes tradeable and so the holder keeps being liquid. The issue with their approach is that only the original owner can unlock the deposit. Currently dCKB does not appear to be actively maintained.

## Solution

### Enter CKB++

CKB++ is the provisional name for a [sUDT token](https://talk.nervos.org/t/rfc-simple-udt-draft-spec/4333) that represents deposits in the protocol. As with dCKB, CKB++'s approach is to tokenize NervosDAO receipts, but with a twist: the protocol owns all the CKB deposits and maintains a pool of them. This means that all the deposits and withdrawals are shared, so anyone can use anyone else's deposit to exit once it's mature.

This protocol aims to solve two problems with NervosDAO:

- CKB locked in the NervosDAO remains liquid and it can truly be used as a normal currency.
- CKB++ can be converted back to CKB quickly at any time without having to wait for maturity.

### Water Mill Analogy

As a [water mill](https://tenor.com/view/water-wheel-mill-gif-19806697) has many distinct buckets, each at different wheel positions, in which the water is:

- Collected
- Maintained
- Released

In the same way, the protocol can have many distinct liquidity buckets, each of them constantly moving at different stages of maturity:

- Collected: Users deposit CKB into liquidity buckets and receive CKB++.
- Maintained: Liquidity buckets accrue interest in the NervosDAO.
- Released: If a user wants to exchange CKB++ for CKB, they can use any liquidity bucket that is at maturity.

### Feedback

Jordan Mack's comments on Nervos L1 & CKB++:
> In a more abstract sense, this doesn't violate any of intentions of the platform. The CKB that is staked is still out of circulation. CKB++ does not grant the holder the ability to store data on the blockchain. In the most pure sense, CKB++ is enabling the functionality that dCKB was trying to achieve. It better solves the problem because anyone can unlock the original CKB from the NervosDAO using CKB++ instead of requiring the original owner to unlock it as with dCKB.

## Team

### Rise of Phroi

I'm the the ideas baker and solidity developer behind Opthy, 3Â° among peers at August 2021 Hackathon! [Phroi](https://phroi.com) as pseudonym exists since that Hackathon, here you can find the code I wrote in that occasion: [core](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-core), [tests](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-tests) and [ui](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v0-ui-web). Later on I continued working with Hexmate on [Opthy](https://github.com/opthydefi/opthy-v1-core), receiving funding from Nervos Foundation.

### Strengths

- Innovative!
- Self-motivated!
- Up for the challenge!

### Weaknesses

- My soft skills!
- My broken English!
- Too humble, or so they say!

### Discovering CKB++

Fast forward, two months ago while [testing the ground for Hexmate's ISPO](https://discord.com/channels/657799690070523914/657799690552606745/943306112889933864), I discovered the untapped need for a token that liquefies and bridges interests from L1 to L2 and so I started researching its feasibility.

### Departing from Hexmate to Focus on CKB++

In the meantime I embarked on a journey of all-round self-discovery and after a while I realized that I identify as a solo Indie Hacker, a long time dream. Coincidentally CKB++ is of the right size to be incrementally worked on as a solo Indie Hacker!

While nobody is able to work in total isolation, with the right feedback, guidance and support from Nervos Team, Community & Foundation I can transform CKB++ into a reality in a less than year.

This protocol could also enable the future development of Hexmate using a ISPO, which I highly support and anticipate!

## Core Layer

### Core Layer is On-Chain, Trust-Less & Decentralized

This part of the protocol lives completely on-chain. Once deployed it is independent and not upgradable. It wraps NervosDAO transactions by transforming them into CKB++ and does not require a receipt. It tracks all deposits by a fixed amount of CKB++, so CKB capacity for any deposit is determined by the current exchange rate of CKB for CKB++.

### CKB / CKB++ Exchange Rate

The CKB to CKB++ exchange rate is determined by epoch. If we could go back in time to epoch 0, then 1 CKB would be equal to 1 CKB++. As time passes 1 CKB is slowly worth less than 1 CKB++ at a rate that matches the issuance from the NervosDAO. This is because CKB++ is gaining value. An easier way to understand this is to think of:

- CKB as inflationary
- CKB++ as non-inflationary

Jordan Mack's comment on this method:
> That's a clever approach. Thinking of it as CKB++ being the base and CKB being what is moving makes it much easier to understand.

The inflation rate of CKB is well defined by the [NervosDAO compensation rate](https://explorer.nervos.org/charts/nominal-apc) and only depends on:

- [The block concept in L1](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary/#block)
- [The epoch concept in L1](https://docs.nervos.org/docs/basics/glossary/#epoch)
- [The formula itself](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation)

Therefore, the CKB/CKB++ exchange rate will always be precise as determined by the formula and the current epoch/block. The only risk to this deterministic peg would be a smart contract exploit to the deposit pool or minting contract. These kinds of attack vectors are greatly mitigated by external audits.

### Fixed CKB++-Equivalent Deposit Size

Let's **assume** we don't implement any requirement on deposit size, so as in NervosDAO users can choose the deposit size they prefer. Then an attacker who can borrow a big enough capital can simply:

- Exchange CKB++ for smaller CKB deposits.
- Deposit CKB for CKB++ in deposits as big as the entirety of his capital.

This would greatly reduce the quality of the service for everyone, as the only remaining deposits would be as big or bigger than the attacker capital and since it's impossible to withdraw partially from a NervosDAO deposit, this would greatly hamper the protocol fruition.

Let's now instead **assume** we require deposits to be capped at certain size. Then as before an attacker who can borrow a capital as big as the maximum deposit size can simply:

- Exchange CKB++ for smaller CKB deposits.
- Deposit CKB for CKB++ in deposits as big as the maximum deposit size.

This would greatly reduce the quality of the service for users trying to withdraw smaller deposits, as the only remaining deposits would be as big as the maximum deposit size and since it's impossible to withdraw partially from a NervosDAO deposit, this would hamper the protocol fruition for a whole category of users.

A good countermeasure is to fix a reasonably small standard deposit size. As in real life bricks can be used to build houses of any size, in the same way:

- Deposits too big should be split into standard deposits and possibly even spread over longer periods.
- Deposits too small are better served by secondary markets.

This deposit standard size could be defined in CKB terms or in CBK++ terms:

- A fixed CKB means that as deposit are made in time, every deposit would have a different size due to the NervosDAO interests, so it's not working as intended.
- A fixed CKB++-equivalent deposit size means that at every block all the deposits would have the same size both in CKB and CKB++. Of course as time passes, the deposit size would be fixed CKB++-equivalent terms but gradually increasing in CKB terms.

In this way a few goals are achieved:

- Big deposits now increase the overall protocol liquidity.
- No size mismatch means anybody can use anybody else deposit freely to withdraw.
- A fixed CKB++-equivalent deposit size simplifies code, so it minimizes the hacks attack surface.

### Deposits from Core Layer Perspective

In NervosDAO a CKB holder can lock his CKB in exchange for a receipt of that specific deposit, while in our case the protocol proceed by wrapping NervosDAO deposit transaction into CKB++. The protocol in one transaction:

- Requires a fixed CKB++-equivalent size deposit.
- Takes control of the deposit.
- Stakes it in NervosDAO.
- Adds the receipt to its pool of receipts.
- Mints to the depositor a fixed amount of CKB++.

### Withdrawals from Core Layer Perspective

Withdrawals are a bit more complicated in NervosDAO, time is slotted in batches of 180 epochs depending on the initial deposit timing, so a withdrawal goes like this:

- With the first transaction the user request the withdrawal.
- With the second transaction the user withdraw the deposit plus interests. Must be after the end of the 180 epoch batch in which the first transaction happened.

As seen with [calculations](https://github.com/nervosnetwork/rfcs/blob/master/rfcs/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw/0023-dao-deposit-withdraw.md#calculation) the actual withdrawn CKB amount depends on the timing of the request of withdrawal transaction in respect to the epoch batch.

While in our case the protocol proceed by un-wrapping CKB++ transactions into base NervosDAO transactions:

- The CKB++ holder **freely** chooses from the pool a deposit to withdraw from. All deposits are of a fixed CKB++-equivalent size, the only differentiating factor between them is the recurring maturity date.
- With the first transaction the user sends to the protocol the fixed amount of CKB++ and chooses the specific deposit to withdraw from, while the protocol in turn assigns to the user that specific deposit and burns the received CKB++.
- With the second transaction the user withdraws the equivalent CKB amount. Same constraints as with the second NervosDAO transaction.

## Incentivization Layer

### Incentivization Layer is On-Chain, Trust-Less & Decentralized

As for the Core, the Incentivization Layer of the protocol lives completely on-chain, once deployed it's independent from any entity, so it's not upgradable. This Layer exist as the protocol needs to incentivize a well time distributed deposit pool and needs to dis-incentivize actions that leads to the opposite. Since direct access to the Core Layer is disabled this layer cannot be bypassed.

### Adding Incentives and Disincentives

Any improvement aimed to incentivize a well time distributed deposit pool involves fees. In particular this entails a central entity with automated logic, so a L1 script, which with-in every user transaction:

- Sets disincentives in form of CKB++ fees.
- Accumulates them.
- Distributes incentives in form of CKB++ benefits.

There are two advantages of asking for CKB++ fees, such as either:

- A slight lock-in, as the user needs to fetch from secondary markets these additional CKB++ for paying the fees.
- A more liquid protocol, as the user prioritizes actions without fees, so actions that benefit everyone.

Another approach would be to have strict rules, for example that clearly states when a deposit/withdrawal can happen or not, but usually it's easier for a determined attacker to abuse strict rules against everyone else.

In the following sections I'll refer to the **epoch population** concept, this is a short hand for quantity of deposits at maturity in a certain epoch in the Core Layer deposit pool.

### Deposits from Incentivization Layer Perspective

Depositing means adding a shared resource, so any other user will be able to use it, but there is a catch.

Let's **assume** we don't implement the Incentivization Layer, so users have direct access to the Core Layer. Then a attacker with minimal expenditure of capital can simply:

- Exchange CKB++ for CKB deposits in sparsely populated epochs.
- Deposit CKB for CKB++ in already densely populated epochs.

This would greatly reduce the quality of the service for everyone, as the protocol ability to exchange CKB++ into CKB would be halted outside the overpopulated epochs, hampering its fruition.

So the catch is that the utility of a deposit depends on how much already populated is that epoch.

A good countermeasure is to add deposit fees that depends on how much is populated the epoch:

- Over-populated: high deposit fees, up to 180 epochs worth of CKB interests.
- Average populated: from minimal to no deposit fees.
- Scarcely populated: from no fees to incentives.

Of course this heuristic must take in account and shape appropriately big inflow periods of CKB such as the bootstrapping period or in general deposits of size comparable to the deposit pool.

### Withdrawals from Incentivization Layer Perspective

Withdrawing means consuming a shared resource, so any other user will not be able to use it.

Let's **assume** we don't implement the Incentivization Layer, so users have direct access to the Core Layer. Then a attacker with minimal expenditure of capital can simply:

- Exchange CKB++ for CKB deposits near maturity.
- Deposit CKB for CKB++, postponing the maturity.

An attack aimed at postponing indefinitely the deposit maturity would greatly reduce the quality of the service for everyone, hampering its fruition.

A good countermeasure is to add withdrawal fees that depends on how much is populated the epoch:

- Scarcely populated: high withdrawal fees, up to 180 epochs worth of CKB interests.
- Average populated: from minimal to no withdrawal fees.
- Over-populated: from no fees to incentives.

Of course this heuristic must take in account and shape appropriately big outflow events of CKB such as a bank run or in general withdrawals of size comparable to the deposit pool.

## Periphery Layer

### Taking Care of User Needs

The Core Layer of the protocol defines a solid way to exchange between CKB and CKB++ in fixed blocks, while the Incentivization Layer takes care of making this exchange liquid.

The standard deposit size makes already very easy for most users to exchange back and forth between CKB and CKB++, but naturally there are two under-served categories of users:

- Big depositors, those with a capital more than hundred times the standard deposit size. These users would otherwise need to spend a lot of time manually choosing the timing for each standard deposit.
- Small depositors, those with a capital smaller than the standard deposit size. These users would otherwise need to rely on secondary markets.

On one side we have defined a protocol essentially by excluding ideas not compatible with NervosDAO substrate, on the other we have these very legit user needs.

The Periphery Layer addresses these user needs, making the the protocol handy to use irrespective of user capital size.

### Periphery Layer's Requirements

We need a technology that can adequately prioritize variable user needs and interface them to the fixed blocks used by protocol Internal layers, but actually in the wild already exists a more general solution to this problem: we are essentially approaching a CKB / CKB++ market!

Theoretically any kind of technology that enables market price discovery could work. This is because we can develop an off-chain bot that every time the CKB / CKB++ price is unbalanced, it arbitrages the price difference between the CKB / CKB++ market and the protocol, balancing it back again.

Currently in the DeFi space there are two main techniques of price discovery:

- [Geometric Mean Market Maker](https://arxiv.org/abs/1911.03380) such as Uniswap, a new and evolving solution.
- [Limit Orders Book](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/order-book.asp) based markets, the traditional solution.

Geometric Mean Market Makers are a form of Automated Market Makers. On one side they are very successful in DeFi as they're relatively easy to implement, provide liquidity to and trade against. On the other side, trades of size comparable to the liquidity pool experience high slippage. While of course this behavior depends on the bonding curve and liquidity pool size, they don't seem to solve properly our problem.

Limit Orders Book based markets are the traditional solution, trades of any size can work around Market Orders slippage by using Limit Orders. In DeFi there are some issues due to the associated cost of every on-chain transaction, so high frequency trading is impractical, which may actually be positive!

So a variation of this technique could fit our high level requirements, which are:

- CKB / CKB++ exchange rate is well defined, so any significant deviation must be easily arbitraged back.
- Arbitraging should have no barrier to entry, being closer to triggering a method than arbitraging.
- Limit orders are needed to interface, abstract and adequately prioritize deposits & withdrawals.
- A form of Automated Market Maker is needed to minimize liquidity providers interactions.
- Every stakeholder should be as liquid as possible.
- Fair incentives for every stakeholder.

In this protocol the stakeholders are:

- Traders.
- Liquidity providers.
- Price arbitrageurs.
- Service maintainers.

### Deposits from Periphery Layer Perspective

Deposits are basically limit orders seeking to convert CKB into CKB++. They can be matched partially or fully by:

- An arbitrageur who creates in the Incentivization Layer a new deposit using one or more limit order funds, minting CKB++ tokens in the process and later distributing them correctly. No capital required from the arbitrageur.
- A counterparty seeking to convert CKB++ into CKB.

### Withdrawals from Periphery Layer Perspective

Withdrawals are basically limit orders seeking to convert CKB++ into CKB. They can be matched partially or fully by:

- An arbitrageur who creates in the Incentivization Layer a new withdrawal request for a deposit near maturity using one or more limit order funds, burning those CKB++ in the process and later distributing the withdrawn CKB correctly. No capital required from the arbitrageur.
- A counterparty seeking to convert CKB into CKB++.

## Path to Sustainability

[To cite a section from the blog that introduced Uniswap V2 to the World](https://uniswap.org/blog/uniswap-v2#path-to-sustainability):

>Decentralization is in many ways about increasing participation and removing central points of failure. Uniswap V1 is already highly decentralized, trustless, and censorship resistant. But for it to achieve its full potential as infrastructure in a fair and open financial system â it must continue to grow and improve.
>
>To open a path to self-sustainability, the code for Uniswap V2 includes a small protocol charge mechanism. At launch, the protocol charge will default to 0, and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.30%. If the protocol charge is switched on, it will become 0.05% and the liquidity provider fee will be 0.25%.
>
>This feature, including the exact percentage amounts, is hardcoded into the core contracts which remain decentralized and non-upgradable. It can be turned on, and directed by, a decentralized governance process deployed after the Uniswap V2 launch. There is no expectation that it will be turned on in the near future but it opens the possibility for future exploration.

In the same way the Periphery Layer, both the arbitrage bot and the market platform, could include a hardcoded fee switch, turned off at the beginning. This is good as it leads to a future where service maintainers are incentivized to fulfill their role for the long run and upgrade it to a DAO.

In the beginning the service offered by the Periphery Layer will be directly managed by me. This could even work in the long term as it's still decentralized as anyone can arbitrage between the Inner protocol and Periphery Layer. To be even more decentralized a third party could design a totally independent system to interface users and the Inner protocol, as the latter it's already totally decentralized.

In the long term a DAO should take over the Periphery Layer and manage it, but this would carry a big development overhead, so it's something that can only happen at a later time.

After seeing [this Jan Xie's comment (reported by Alejandro)](https://discord.com/channels/657799690070523914/657799690552606745/970714873661128774) I need to understand better the time (and so the costs) associated with developing the L1 scripts, so I'm holding this section off until I complete the [Developer Training Course](https://nervos.gitbook.io/developer-training-course/):

>If you compare the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum, you might find that Ethereum developers are amazing as they can create dApps in a short time while Bitcoin developers can take two years to create an app. Nervos CKB is more similar to Bitcoin. Building applications directly in CKB is similar to system level programming, not front end programming. In a nutshell, Nervos CKB and Bitcoin have totally different designs than Ethereum.

## Road-Map & Incentives

While I'm pretty independent, I'll go from learning L1 scripting to creating a complex L1 protocol, so in all likelihood I'll need substantial support from Nervos Team, Community & Foundation.

### First Month: Proof of Concept

I'll create a Proof of Concept L1 script, showing the basic functionalities of the core layer from command line. Possibly not safe to use in production, but with a clear path to a safe resolution.

This is a risky period, there might exists some technical blocks long or impossible to work around. While I designed CKB++ from the bottom-up and I love everything about it, I need to ask Nervos Foundation for a starting 1000 USD-equivalent in incentives for the first month of work, so both parties are taking a small risk.

### First Four Months: Core & Incentivization Layers

I'll need to simulate any adverse user interaction with the protocol incentives and only then I'll create the definitive L1 scripts for Core & Incentivization Layers. This code will be released under a Business Source License 1.1 (BUSL-1.1), the same kind license as [Uniswap v3 core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v3-core/blob/main/LICENSE).

Moreover I'll set-up a L1 Testnet based basic website. This website will provide users the ability to directly interact with the Incentivization Layer, with the addition of off-chain utilities for gradually exchanging CKB and CKB++. This will happen both by keeping the browser tab open or by a stand-alone script. This code will be released under a GNU General Public License v3.0 or later (GPL-3.0-or-later), in this way anybody can do almost anything with the interface code, except distributing a closed source version.

If time permits it I'll set-up these L1 scrips on Mainnet and add a basic styling on this website.

Once these layer are online I'll personally gain nothing from them, so I need to ask for additional 10000 USD-equivalent in incentives for the additional three months of work. This excludes external Core & Incentivization Layers audits or expenses to deploy them on Mainnet.

### First Ten Months: Fully Working Protocol

I'll need to simulate any adverse user interaction with the Periphery Layer and only then I'll create the L1 scripts for the Periphery Layer. As with Core & Incentivization L1 scripts this code will be released under BUSL-1.1.

I'll create a fully working Testnet and Mainnet well designed website which will provide users the ability to interact either:

- With the Periphery Layer and its associated on-chain limit order utilities for gradually exchanging CKB and CKB++.
- With the Incentivization Layer using its off-chain utilities as a fallback method.

I'll create off-chain arbitraging bots, both integrated in the website and as stand-alone script, that requires no capital to operate, except for paying for the first block-chain transaction fee.

As with the Incentivization layer interface, the web interface and arbitraging bots code will be released under GPL-3.0-or-later.

I'll create a GitBook-alike documenting all the concepts, the layers and the website. It will be released under Creative Commons Attribution Share Alike 4.0 International License (CC-BY-SA-4.0).

Once everything is on Mainnet and audited, I **may** gain personally from this, so I'm open about discussing incentives for this phase, still it's a risky long shot. I estimate the cost for this stage as additional 20000 USD-equivalent in incentives for the additional six months of work. This could happen in two separate steps so that Nervos can evaluate the progress I make on the the Periphery Layers L1 scripts, arbitraging bots and website.

If we audit at the same time Core, Incentivization & Periphery Layer the audit expenses should be lower and so Nervos could fully sponsor them.

About the cost of deploying the Periphery contracts on Mainnet, I need to understand the associated costs and possibly ask for a refund.

### Future Plans

Once this protocol is realized, I may develop a DAO, a token wrapping the generated fees and distributing the arbitrage bot responsibilities. Looking even more far away CKB++ will enable CKB-based Initial Stake Pool Offerings, the official Nervos DAO community voting mechanism and a multitude more L1 & L2 applications!
